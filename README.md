[Specification our the project](./Specification.pdf)

### Models of our choice
***Rebellion (Social Science)***

### Stages of this assignment
This assignment contains 2 stages:

### Report Proposal
This stage should contain:
- a descriptive overview of model you are replicating (eg, purpose, users);
- the design of the existing model (eg, states, update rules);
- the design of your model (eg, classes, attributes, methods);
- the experiments that you intend to run (optionally, some results from the NetLogo model or early results from your model).
- a plan of how you intend to break down your project into tasks and assign them to group members, and a timeline for completion of these tasks. NB: the contribution of each group member should be evenly spread across the tasks and duration of the pro ject.

#### Due Date
- Friday 10 May 2019 at 23:59

### Final project submission
There are two separate submissions to be made:
1. a PDF copy of your report (named A B C report.pdf, where A, B and C are the last names of each group member):
    - The first page of your report must contain the name and student ID of all group members, and the number of words contained in the report.
    - Your report should describe the background for the model, the design of your model and extension, results of your experiments, and a discussion of your findings. The criteria below (Appendix A) provides an indication of the content expected in your report, and should be used to structure the sections of your report.
    - Your report should also include an appendix (maximum length 1/2 page) outlining how your group worked together to achieve the project; eg, successes and challenges confronted, any modifications to the plan outlined in your initial proposal, etc.
    - The report must be no longer than 8 pages (including all tables and figures; 11pt font, with reasonable margins), and contain no more than 1,500 words of text (including figure and table captions). Note: marks will be deducted for reports that exceed these limits. Your reference list (bibliography) and appendix are not included in these page or word limits.
2. a zip file (named A B C code.zip, where A, B and C are the last names of each group member) containing:
    - all source code;
    - any scripts required to run the experiments documented in your report;
    - clear instructions describing how to build and run your model (see note below about not requiring 3rd party dependencies).

#### Programming Language requirements
Code will be tested in a Java SE 8 or Python 3.6 environment (as found on lab computers), and hence must be compliant with Java SE 8 or Python 3.6. 

***Note:*** marks will be deducted if it is not clear how to build and run your model, or your model does not build and run without external dependencies! For example, running your code should not require the use of any third party libraries, IDEs or build tools. If you use an IDE to develop your code, you must check to ensure that it can be built and run independently of the IDE.

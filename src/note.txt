1.
    Scenario:
    All the tugs are occupied by ships that have not commencing dock,
    there are no enough tugs for undocking ships.

    Result:
    This will result in deadlock.

    Solutions:
    Keep 2 tugs available for undocking

    at least 5 tugs is needed

2. Is there time spent on traveling between arrival and depart wait zone?

3. The times between arrivals should vary?

4. The Params Class is not reasonable, if I want modify some parameters, I
should re-compile all the source code.

5. In Berth,
    only one thread executing write operation: use volatile.
    multi thread executing write operation: use synchronized.

6. WaitZone,
    Use Semaphore to control the mutual exclusion in different write methods
    which are trying to modify the same variable.

    The num of ship in arrival wait zone should be less than the num of pilots.

    Use the enum to define the type of waitzone is not that easy to make mistake
    than using String. And it is more easy to debug.

7. wait() and notifyAll()
    use three semaphore que, operation, full
